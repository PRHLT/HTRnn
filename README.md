# Handwritten Text Recognition with PyTorch

This code was updated from the one at [https://github.com/pmuilu/ocr_crnn](https://github.com/pmuilu/ocr_crnn).

This model for *handwritten text recognition* implements CNN+LSTM with CTC loss and beam search CTC decoding. It is required to install [ctcdecode library](https://github.com/parlance/ctcdecode) along with other requirements.
